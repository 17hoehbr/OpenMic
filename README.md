# OpenMic Karaoke

OpenMic is a "KTV"-style karaoke song search and queueing system. It connects to your TV, and shows a QR code for computers and smartphones to connect to a web interface. From there, multiple users can seamlessly search karaoke tracks from YouTube. This project is heavily inspired by the [pikaraoke project](https://github.com/vicwomg/pikaraoke) but completely rewritten to use the web browser as the TV display instead of PyGame / VLC. The end goal is that this project will be simple enough to install and reliable enough that it can easily be used on Steam Decks and other Linux distros by users with no python knowledge.
